<!-- What was the most surprising aspect of working in a group/a thing (or things) you didnâ€™t anticipate? -->
* Learning version control in Github requires careful coordination and communication. 

Also, the way people approach problems and overall software construction varies pretty widely based on learning styles. I learn best by pulling apart something that works and understanding how the parts fit. On personal projects, I dive in and start tinkering immediately.  This project involved learning new tech in addition to extensive planning, so I think the entire group had to meet in the middle so that everyone can learn. Taking time to watch videos and take notes independently was useful for giving everyone an opportunity to learn in their own way. 

<!-- Explain a key feature you worked on. -->
* 1. Initial setup of base level server and app so we could all see our work visually
  2. Github solutions to merge conflicts
  3. Display of data in views.
  4. Early design of navbar and header styles and several components
  5. Heroku deployment 
<!-- Explain a technical challenge you came across. Was it solved? How? -->
* Showing and hiding views was a multiple day challenge. I tried several tricks using toggle before we found React Router. Ultimately, Winton implemented React router and this allowed us to separate views. The greatest technical challenge was actually version control. We spent a lot of time troubleshooting merges before finally landing on a working system.
<!-- Explain what improvements you would make for version 2.0. -->
These are suggestions for improving the operation of our team in coding:
* Establish live share as part of the workflow if this were to continue. People can split up and work on different features without worrying too much about version control. I would like to see authentication and Stripe payments in the future.
* Assign a Studying concept to work on the following day together. We did this with react router and I feel like the whole group understood it well as a result. More focus on identifying what we will need in terms of code and knowledge acquisition earlier in the project week.

<!-- What went well for your group? -->
* our group was very organized. we gave each other specific task and helped each other as much as we could. i would say our team work was the one of the best out of all the groups and would love to work together again.
<!-- Explain a key feature you worked on. -->
* i worked on setting up the header component and while using bootstrap was able to create a carousel that can be utilized for advertising items on sale, and special promotions. kind of proud of that little addition to the project
<!-- Explain a technical challenge you came across. Was it solved? How? --> i found creating a authentication system to be the most challenging. i tried it towards the end of the project but was only able to set up 0auth portion but didnt understand enough to completely get the rest of it done.
*
<!-- Explain what improvements you would make for version 2.0. -->
* Allow users to create there own profiles and logins for a more personalised experience. users will be able add items to their cart and save items for later purchase. i would also improve on my css a bit more and add support for desktop.

### **Stephanie**
<!-- What was your group's biggest struggle? -->
* Our group's biggest struggle was finding our rhythm. We all came from different levels of understanding materials, different study/work patterns, and different coding styles. The first method of getting together and setting up the frame, and delegating out parts of the project slowed us down more than we expected. We had difficulty with commits and merges, but found our pace by Friday evening. Saturday morning, we all started on a good note and on the same page, and us coding together with LiveShare and regular meetups throughout the day really helped. I feel when we worked this way, we were able to accomplish soo much more, and learn new materials as well. 
<!-- Explain a key feature you worked on. -->
* I helped get the props passed through the components, and got the add function working properly. Had we more time, I would have finished making an edit form component with a constructor build similar to our new form component, and make sure to fetch it with a function in the App.js file.
<!-- Explain a technical challenge you came across. Was it solved? How? -->
* We knew we were going to need to use a way to switch between views in React. Jeff found a really great video on YouTube that everyone watched, we tried to work on it together, but were a little brain-fried. We made it a study/homework assignment that night, and we would touch base again the next morning. This helped us grasp the new concept better. Winton was able to get the switches to work 90% by the time morning came around.
<!-- Explain what improvements you would make for version 2.0. -->
* Complete Login Authentication -- Romane was working on this at the end of the project. Edit -- That was my next task. Cart -- complete its function. Vendor/Customer -- separate views to render dependent on login credentials.

### **Winton**
<!-- What was the most useful tool that your group relied on the most? -->
 The most useful tool that our goup encorporated was Visual Studio Codes Live Share feature. It allowed us to write code together which meant we were able to make decisions in the moment and solve issues faster.
<!-- Explain a key feature you worked on. -->
Key features worked on:
 1. Working with react-router-dom to load components individual on the page. 
 2. ProductGrid.js functionality
 3. Adding Css using react-bootstrap
 4. Application mockup
<!-- Explain a technical challenge you came across. Was it solved? How? -->
Technical Challenges
1. We were not able to get our update route to change the product information in the database .
2. CSS in React required unfamiliar tools and concepts, but were able to produce some remarkable results such as the scrolling hero section of the app and styling the apps main form.
<!-- Explain what improvements you would make for version 2.0. -->
Version 2.0 Improvements
1. Have it so that the user can update the products in the inventory.
2. Add authentication.
3. Include an API to find information for items in the inventory.
4. Have is so that users can search to find an item, add it to the cart and check out.
